# GameProject

This app will allow the user to access a Players (their own or an opponents) game collection and compare it to a list of optional filtering categories to generate a short list of games to take to a game night.

### Filtering Categories
* Player dislikes
* Player count
* Game length
* Theme
* Mechanics

This is v1 of this project, strictly Java, HTML and CSS.
All the filtering, add / delete of games, players and mechanics works. It is not as pretty as is could be, but it is functional.
